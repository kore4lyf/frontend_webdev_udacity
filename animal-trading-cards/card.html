			<p>Jellyfish have no brain, heart, bones or eye. They are made up of a smooth, bag-like body and tentacles armed with tiny, stinging cells. These incredible invertebrates use their stinging tentacles to stun or paralyse prey before gobbling it up. The jellyfish's mouth is found in the centre of its body.</p>
